# dijkstra
This repository shows an application of Dijkstra's algorithm in C++. Specifically, the algorithm is performed on a graph represented by a matrix of integers. This matrix is interpreted as a cost graph such that (i, j) is the cost to reach vertex (i, j) from its neighbours.  
This repository also shows the use of template class. Please note: the template class is declared and defined in the header file.
